To play this game, follow on-screen prompts. If, in response to the 
first message, the player inputs a capital Y instead of a lowercase,
they then have the option to input their own cards to the hand 
according to a series of on-screen instructions. This allows for 
easier evaluation of the program.

Each came "costs" one point. The computer will first give you a 
hand of five cards, picked at random from the top of a deck, 
and you have the option of replacing none, some, or all of them, 
in order to get one of the following hands(each worth the number
 of points given in the parentheses):
1. Royal Flush (250) - A, 10, J, Q, and K, same suit 
2. Straight Flush (50) - 5 cards with consecutive ranks of the same suit
3. Four of a Kind (25) - 4 cards with the same rank
4. Full House (6) - 3 cards with the same rank, and 1 pair
5. Flush (5) - 3 cards with the same suit
6. Straight (4) - 5 cards with consecutive ranks
7. Three of a Kind (3) - 3 cards with the same rank
8. Two Pairs (2) - 2 pairs of cards with 2 different ranks
9. One pair (only w/ value above J, 1) - one pair of cards with the same rank.
To replace a card, indicate the number you wish to replace, (shown next
to the card). The card will then be replaced with the next card from the 
deck. Your hand will then be scored, your updated score shown, and you 
will be asked if you want to play again. When you end the game, total 
games played and final score will be shown.
